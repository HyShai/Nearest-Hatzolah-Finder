## Nearest Hatzolah Finder

Implemented using a k-d tree and the nearest neighbor search algorithm.

The epicenters are rough guesses; and some areas are overlapping (seemingly an issue in NYC and Passaic). Please open an issue if you are getting incorrect results.

Currently this is only for North America.
